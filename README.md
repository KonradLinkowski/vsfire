# Firestore Rules
Basic highlighting for new [Firestore security rules](https://cloud.google.com/firestore/docs/reference/security/). Priority for [additional language features](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensionAPI/language-support), in decreasing order of likelihood that I'll get to it:

- Completions (underway in a branch) then update syntax highlighting
- Hovers
- Snippets
- Signature Helpers
- Incremental Formatting
